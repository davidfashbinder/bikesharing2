## Overview of Project
---
The purpose of this project is to develop a compelling Tableau story, with several visualizations.  These visualizations will serve to convince investors to support a bikesharing business in Des Moines, IA.  


### Purpose of Analysis
In this analysis, we are examining data from NYC's CitiBike bikesharing program.  We need to understand the customer profile and behaviors of the CitiBike program in order to best predict its effectiveness and funding needs in Des Moines, IA.  

### Results 

Checkout Times for Users, August Peak Times, Trips by Weekday per Hour

![Checkout Times for Users](https://github.com/davidfashbinder/bikesharing2/blob/main/images/checkouttimes.png)

![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://github.com/davidfashbinder/bikesharing2/blob/main/images/tripsbyweekdayhour.png)

These visualizations show a strong trend - that ridership is high during the work rush hour times, both for those traveling to work and those returning home.  

Checkout by Gender, User Types by Gender, Customer Types, Trips by Gender per Hour

![Trips by Gender per Hour](https://github.com/davidfashbinder/bikesharing2/blob/main/images/tripsbygenderperhour.png)

We can see in the above visualizations that male ridership far outpaces female ridership.  Thee are also more males as subscriber-type customers, which have the highest usage of bikes.  

### Summary

We can see that NYC's CitiBike program is primarily used by male commuters during the morning and afternoon rush hour.  If commuters are going to drive the business in Des Moines, we must create additional visualizations to understand the volume of commuters in the city, as well as their commuting times and demographics.  Census data that shows where the population of Des Moines commutes from and to will also be helpful (trip start and stop locations in the NYC data) in order to plan for where we should put bikes.
